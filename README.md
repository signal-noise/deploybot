# deploybot

> Service with Slack bot interface, connecting CircleCI to GitHub

This project exists in order to allow easy workflow support between Slack, GitHub and CircleCI. It is built using the Serverless framework for AWS Lambda, using Python 2.7.

## Functionality

In essence, the bot triggers deployments using CircleCI, synchronising all data with GitHub, and communicating with users on Slack.

Each Slack channel it is configured on will relate to a single GitHub repository. Based on trigger events, it will create a GitHub `deployment`, derive the workflow-specific information like environment, then trigger a CircleCI build related to that deployment.

Triggers can also be manually activated via the Slack channel; anyone on the channel has permission to run any command.

### Supported workflows

## Usage

The default command is called `cimon`.

In a slack channel, typing `/cimon setup <username>/<repository>` will start the process off, and trigger a message asking you to select your GitHub username from the list of users with access to that repository. `/cimon reset` will forget the setup, though not the user connections.

`/cimon hello` will get the bot to look at the channel's existing repository for GH users that it doesn't already know the Slack usernames of and return the set of buttons. `/cimon goodbye` undoes this for your user.

`/cimon config` will output the current configuration in place.

`/cimon deploy <environment>` triggers a deployment

`/cimon list` shows deployments

npm i

optionally install docker...(nb circleci)

sls deploy

## Project structure

The project is a single service (inasmuch as there is a single serverless config file), but with various endpoints and subareas.

The three main divisions of the codebase are around the third party connectors: `slack`, `github` and `circleci`. Each of these has a single file per endpoint.

Some of the endpoints have HTTP access enabled in order to connect to e.g. webhook events; these are all secured with tokenised validation according to each of the providers' specs.

Other endpoints are only accessible via internal Lambda invoke calls, and are unsecured other than inbuilt AWS permissions.

### Slack

Slack functionality is divided in the same way that Slack's own connetors are split. ; we have an endpoint for each of `message`, `command`, `interactive` and `event`.

- `command` is the guts of the bot; this handles all commands sent to the main slash command exposed by the Slack app config.
- `interactive` is the endpoint that handles responses triggered by buttons pressed in custom messages.
- `message` is used to send event-based messages to a slack channel based on external stimuli
- `event` is the endpoint for Slack events such as users joining rooms.

### Github

The GitHub connectors are slightly more varied.

- `webhook` receives all events from a repository and therefore has an HTTP endpoint.
- `collaborators` takes a repository as input, queries the GH GraphQL API and returns just the usernames of the people with access to that repo. This is not configured for HTTP access, and is only meant to be called by other Lambda functions.

### CircleCI

- `trigger` POSTS to the CircleCI API to trigger a job called `build` on the given repo.

### Asana

## Data model

Data is saved into three `DynamoDB` tables as follows.

###Â Project

This saves the `slack_channelid` against the `repository` (in the format `github-username/repository-name`) to act as a reference and enforce a single channel against a single repo. It also saves the `slack_channel` (i.e. the human-readable name) to simplify things and help debugging.

### User

This simple table saves the `slack_userid` against the `github_username`, to allow _@_ notifications from GitHub events in Slack. Again, it also stores `slack_username` for ease of use.

### Build

The core of the app revolves around this. Each GitHub `deployment` corresponds to a single item in this table. Each item in this table can have all the following attributes:

- Repository
- Commit hash
- Branch / tag / PR ref
- Committer
- Environment
- Build number
- Build URL
- Deploy URL
- Deploy datetime
- Slack Message ID
- Ticket reference (Asana or gh ticket)
- Trigger (if needed over other attributes)
